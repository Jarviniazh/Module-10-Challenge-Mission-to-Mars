# Mission to Mars

## Overview of the project

### Purpose

To help a junior data scientist Robin to build a web application. She is big fan of astronomy and dreams one day to work for NASA, so this web app could be the start point. Based on Robinâ€™s plan we will write a script that would gather all the information she searches for into one convenient location, and once she gathered it, what if she could show it off to other Astrofiles.

First, apply Mongo database to download tables, paragraphs, and images, then use Flask to put it all together. Finally we would use Bootstrap to polish the webpages.
